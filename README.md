This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Deploy on Render.com

To deploy this application on Render.com:

1. Fork or clone this repository to your GitHub account
2. Create a new Web Service on Render.com
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the following environment variables in the Render dashboard:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your Turso database URL
   - `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Turso database auth token
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: Your Render.com app URL (e.g., https://your-app-name.onrender.com)

The deployment will automatically use the configuration from `render.yaml`.

Note: This deployment is configured to support file uploads and database operations, which may not work properly on other platforms due to readonly filesystem restrictions.
